# Design Interrogation Checklist

Before delivering any visual output, systematically question each design decision. This is an internal process—the user sees only the refined result.

## Typography

### Hierarchy
- [ ] Is there a clear primary heading that anchors the page?
- [ ] Can you identify exactly 3 levels of hierarchy (primary, secondary, body)?
- [ ] Does size difference between levels feel deliberate (not just "a bit bigger")?

### Weight & Style
- [ ] Is font weight consistent within hierarchy levels?
- [ ] Are you using weight for emphasis rather than color or italics?
- [ ] Is body text between 400-500 weight for readability?

### Spacing
- [ ] Is line-height appropriate? (1.4-1.6 for body, 1.1-1.3 for headings)
- [ ] Is letter-spacing neutral or slightly loose? (Never tight for body text)
- [ ] Does paragraph spacing create clear content blocks?

### Choice
- [ ] Does the typeface match the tone? (System fonts are often fine)
- [ ] If using a custom font, is it loaded efficiently?
- [ ] Is the font readable at all sizes used?

## Color

### Palette Coherence
- [ ] Are you using 3 or fewer primary colors?
- [ ] Do accent colors have purpose (success, warning, primary action)?
- [ ] Is the palette warm-neutral, not cold?

### Contrast & Accessibility
- [ ] Does text meet WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large)?
- [ ] Are interactive elements clearly distinguishable?
- [ ] Would this work in grayscale?

### Emotional Tone
- [ ] Does the color evoke the right feeling?
- [ ] Are achievement/success indicators warm, not cold?
- [ ] Are error states helpful, not alarming?

### Restraint
- [ ] Could any color be removed or muted?
- [ ] Is color adding meaning or just decoration?
- [ ] Are you resisting the urge to add "pops of color"?

## Layout

### Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Does the eye flow naturally through the content?
- [ ] Is the most important element most prominent?
- [ ] Are related items grouped visually?

### Spacing System
- [ ] Are you using consistent spacing increments (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)?
- [ ] Is there enough breathing room? (When in doubt, add space)
- [ ] Does spacing reflect content relationships?

### Alignment
- [ ] Is everything aligned to a clear grid or system?
- [ ] Are there stray elements that break alignment?
- [ ] Does center alignment serve a purpose? (Usually left-align is better)

### White Space
- [ ] Is negative space intentional and generous?
- [ ] Are margins substantial enough? (Often 24px+ for main content)
- [ ] Does the design feel cramped anywhere?

---

## Interaction & States

### Affordances
- [ ] Do clickable things look clickable?
- [ ] Do form inputs look editable?
- [ ] Are interactive elements large enough to click/tap?

### States
- [ ] Is there hover feedback for interactive elements?
- [ ] Are disabled states clearly communicated?
- [ ] Are loading states handled gracefully?

### Focus & Error
- [ ] Are focus states visible for keyboard navigation?
- [ ] Are error messages helpful and specific?
- [ ] Do validation states feel supportive, not punishing?

---

## Progress & Motivation (for learning/achievement UIs)

### Encouragement
- [ ] Do empty states encourage rather than shame?
- [ ] Does progress visualization feel rewarding?
- [ ] Is there recognition for effort, not just completion?

### Pressure Check
- [ ] Are streaks supportive or anxiety-inducing?
- [ ] Is comparison to others absent or opt-in only?
- [ ] Does "0 progress" feel like a fresh start, not failure?

### Celebration
- [ ] Are achievements acknowledged without being childish?
- [ ] Is the celebration proportional to the achievement?
- [ ] Do success states use warm colors (greens, ambers)?

---

## Final Pass

- [ ] What can be removed without losing meaning?
- [ ] Does this feel calm and professional?
- [ ] Would you be proud to show this to a designer you respect?
- [ ] Does it look intentional, not template-generated?
