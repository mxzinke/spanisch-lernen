# Design Reference Library

Exemplars to draw inspiration from. Study their principles, don't copy their pixels.

## Notion

### What They Do Well
- **Calm interface**: Nothing fights for attention
- **Warm neutrals**: Soft grays with slight warmth
- **Generous whitespace**: Content breathes
- **Encouraging empty states**: "Add a page" feels like opportunity, not obligation
- **Subtle shadows**: Barely perceptible depth

### Key Techniques to Borrow
- Page backgrounds: `#ffffff` with subtle warm gray sidebar
- Text hierarchy through weight, not color
- Icons that feel hand-drawn but precise
- Hover states that reveal, not highlight
- Minimal borders, shadows for depth instead

### When to Reference
- Document-like interfaces
- Content-heavy layouts
- Note-taking or organizational tools
- When you want "quiet productivity"

## Linear

### What They Do Well
- **Restrained typography**: Few sizes, dramatic hierarchy
- **Purposeful whitespace**: Information density without crowding
- **Subtle transitions**: Everything feels connected
- **Dark mode mastery**: If implementing dark mode
- **Task-focused**: UI disappears when you're working

### Key Techniques to Borrow
- Status indicators: subtle color coding
- Keyboard-first interactions (but mouse still works)
- Progressive disclosure for complex features
- Monospace for IDs/codes, sans-serif for content
- Border-radius consistency: usually 6-8px

### When to Reference
- Productivity tools
- Task/project management
- Developer-facing interfaces
- When you need information density

## Apple

### What They Do Well
- **Precision spacing**: Everything is mathematically intentional

- **Typography mastery**: SF Pro system

### Key Techniques to Borrow
- Large, readable text sizes
- Rounded rectangles with large radius (12-16px)
- Semantic color usage (red for destructive, not just errors)
- Full-bleed sections for emphasis
- Animation timing (200-300ms, ease-in-out)

### When to Reference

## Duolingo (The Tasteful Parts)

### What They Do Well

- **Progress that feels real**: Tangible sense of advancement
- **Consistent character**: Personality without being annoying
- **Celebration proportionality**: Small wins, small celebrations

### What to Avoid
- Over-gamification (streaks as punishment)
- Notification pressure
- Comparison leaderboards (for learning contexts)
- Cartoon animations (unless brand-appropriate)

### Key Techniques to Borrow
- Progress bars that feel substantial

## Swiss/International Style (Principles)

### Core Tenets
- **Grid systems**: Everything aligns to a mathematical grid
- **Sans-serif typography**: Clean, readable, universal
- **Asymmetric balance**: Visual tension resolved through proportion
- **White space as element**: Emptiness is designed, not leftover
- **Photography over illustration**: When images are needed

### Application to Digital
- 8px grid baseline
- Modular scale for typography (1.25 or 1.333 ratio)
- Left-aligned text, strong vertical rhythm
- Minimal color, maximum contrast
- Function determines form

### When to Reference
- When in doubt about fundamentals
- Data-heavy interfaces
- Professional/corporate contexts
- When reducing to essentials

## Anti-References (What to Avoid)

### Over-Designed SaaS
- Gradient buttons on gradient backgrounds
- "Glassmorphism" without purpose
- Animated backgrounds
- Floating shapes as decoration

### Aggressive Growth UX
- Urgency everywhere ("Only 2 left!")
- Social proof manipulation ("1,247 people viewing this")
- Dark patterns in opt-outs
- Guilt-based engagement

### Template-Generated Feel
- Stock photo headers
- Generic icon sets without curation
- Color schemes that don't match content
- "Hero section" → "Features grid" → "Testimonials" → "CTA" autopilot
